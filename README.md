#mod3
mod3 is, at its most basic level, a C++ library. However, it is not very similar to other C++ libraries. The leading design goal behind mod3 is consistency. This means that mod3 is built on the philosophy that as little non-consistent code should be used as possible.

This, of course, means that mod3 reimplements a large portion of the standard library.

That is why mod3, originally simply a name, now stands for Multiple Orders of Destruction - as mod3 in no way is meant to be stable or something that should ever be used.

Rather, mod3 is simply a hacked together tool for hacked together projects. Legitimate uses of mod3 include Ludum Dare and other informal situations.

However, in almost no situation is mod3 the best choice - as it is essentially an experiment by a teenager to build a gigantic programmatic toolbox. This means there is no guarantee that anything in mod3 will not set your computer on fire.

### functionality
In its current state, mod3 provides approximately two half-baked container classes - List<type> and String. It also implements its own Exception class because - consistency.

### documentation
Documentation for mod3 should hopefully be built someday. If it is, it will be available [here](http://themonsterfromthedeep.github.io/mod3/).
