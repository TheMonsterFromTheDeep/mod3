#mod3
mod3 is a project to build a multi-purpose C++ library that includes a large range of abilities, from simple data structures (strings, lists, etc) to cross-platform windowing.
### Goals
There is no main goal for the project. If it goes far, hopefully it will be useable for building applications. However, if it doesn't make it there, it is a resource for understanding C++ better - both an educational project for the author and potentially any viewers.
### Functions
Right now mod3 has no functionality. Anything that mod3 contains should be in the [dev](https://github.com/TheMonsterFromTheDeep/mod3/tree/dev) branch until it is useable in some form.
### Documentation
In the future all documentation should be available at http://themonsterfromthedeep.github.io/mod3/. Right now the project is basically empty so there is no documentation.
